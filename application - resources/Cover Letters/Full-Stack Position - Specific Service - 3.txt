Hi! I am Adean, a Full-Stack Developer and Systems Architect specializing in Databases and Software Development.

I have read your job posting and would like to submit my application. I believe that my 4-year industry experience may be what you need to achieve your goal.

Based on what you have described, you will need to add a tracker. Depending on your architecture, you can add the pixel tracker on the front-end or invoke an addition API trigger through a custom REST service from the back-end. Either way, you will require a custom platform to manage the exchange which will be another microservice.

I feel that my expertise which spans from creating REST services to creating client UI fits well with the project you have in mind.

Also, my full-stack skills mainly cover the following domain:
- Proficient in front-end frameworks (e.g. Vue, Angular, and Riot)
- Proficient in back-end REST frameworks (ExpressJs, Flask, Django Rest, Lumen, and Slim)
- Design and manage databases (e.g. PSQL, MySQL, MSSQL, MongoDB, CouchDB, etc.)
- Create cross-platform mobile applications with Cordova and NativeScript
- Write applications with stack solutions (e.g. CodeIgniter, Laravel, Django and etc.)

Feel free to send an email if you'd like to explore this opportunity with me. Thank you and God bless.
