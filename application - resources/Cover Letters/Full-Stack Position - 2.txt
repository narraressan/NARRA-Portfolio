- Proficient in back-end REST frameworks (ExpressJs, Flask, Django Rest, Lumen, and Slim)
- Design and manage databases (e.g. PSQL, MySQL, MSSQL, MongoDB, CouchDB, etc.)
- Create cross-platform mobile applications with Cordova and NativeScript
- Write applications with stack solutions (e.g. CodeIgniter, Laravel, Django and etc.)
