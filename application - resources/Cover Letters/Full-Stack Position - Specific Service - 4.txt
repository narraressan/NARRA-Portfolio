Hi! I am Adean, a Full-Stack Developer and Systems Architect specializing in Databases and Software Development.

I have read your job posting and would like to submit my application. I believe that my 4-year industry experience may be what you need to achieve your goal.

Based on what you have described, you will need an automated PHP program to run on a nightly basis as well as separate service to analyze the data from the database and generate reports.

I believe that my 3-year experience with setting up automation processes for web crawlers and ETL services can be an advantage to the completion of this project.

Also, my full-stack skills mainly cover the following domain:
- Proficient in front-end frameworks (e.g. Vue, Angular, and Riot)
- Proficient in back-end REST frameworks (ExpressJs, Flask, Django Rest, Lumen, and Slim)
- Design and manage databases (e.g. PSQL, MySQL, MSSQL, MongoDB, CouchDB, etc.)
- Create cross-platform mobile applications with Cordova and NativeScript
- Write applications with stack solutions (e.g. CodeIgniter, Laravel, Django and etc.)
- Automation and management with (NightmareJs, puppeteer, selenium, and Airflow)

Feel free to send an email if you'd like to explore this opportunity with me. Thank you and God bless.
