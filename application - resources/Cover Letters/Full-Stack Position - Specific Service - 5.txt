Hi! I am Adean, a Full-Stack Developer and Systems Architect specializing in Databases and Software Development.

I have read your job posting and would like to submit my application. I believe that my 4-year web crawling experience may be what you need to achieve your goal.

I have been a part of a web crawling company for more than 3 years and has been familiarized with different web crawling strategies. Also, my expertise is not only limited to web crawling, but I am also well rounded with a variety of market grade back-end and front-end tools and frameworks.

I feel that my expertise fits well with the application you are planning to create, feel free to send an email if you'd like to explore this opportunity with me. Thank you.
