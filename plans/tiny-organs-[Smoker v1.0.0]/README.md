# NARRA-TINY-ORGANS
- tiny organs [Smoker v1.0.0]

Description: This library is a very simple implementation of an automated asynchronous testing. It aims to help smoke testing easier. It utilizes Phantomjs (Headless browser)
to carry out smoke test cases, thus not suitable for browser compatibility evaluation.

Features

Limitations:
	Since it is designed to run through a full course of smoke testing, methods that imply a if else case is not supported. However, you may design a single course 
	expecting only one outcome of your if else scenario.
